            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The Aerodrifter is a hovercraft designed to explore Titan, Saturn's largest moon. The project tackles the challenges of Titan's unique environment, including its low gravity, high atmospheric density, and extreme cold. The hovercraft aims to achieve high mobility and adaptability while meeting NASA's stringent requirements for planetary exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                This innovative design integrates cutting-edge propulsion, structural, and control systems, enabling the hovercraft to navigate Titan's surface at an altitude of 2 kilometers. The goal is to demonstrate a prototype capable of operating efficiently within the constraints of weight, size, and power limitations.

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>
                The Aerodrifter's design combines experimental and computational methods to optimize performance. Key design elements include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Circular shape (16” diameter, 8” height) to distribute stress evenly and fit storage constraints.</li>
                <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> Powered by two Firefly motors with impeller and propeller configurations.</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller for autonomous functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Lightweight materials for a total system mass of 497g, under the 800g constraint.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Results and Key Findings</h3>
            <p>
                The Aerodrifter was tested under simulated Titan conditions, and the following results were obtained:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lift:</strong> Achieved 19 N, exceeding the design goal for Titan's lower gravity.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Total power consumption of 25.9 W, with a net power surplus of 5.3 W.</li>
                <li><strong>Payload Capacity:</strong> Successfully carried a 200g payload while maintaining stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Completed a 53-second figure-eight test run and a 159-second endurance test.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Design Justification</h3>
            <p>
                The circular shape was chosen for its ability to evenly distribute stress along the arc, enhancing structural integrity and lift efficiency. Adaptations for Titan's low gravity and high atmospheric density ensure optimal performance with minimal power consumption. The system fits within the strict constraints of size, mass, and power.
